RULES
-- make clear easy to read logs that start with emojis so the human can track
-- use existing code patterns to the best of your abilities
-- for all UI decisions, refer to the magnite-style-guide.md
-- AFTER completing code changes, make implementation notes in the given planning doc (do NOT delete, just add in notes in appropriate section) UNLESS the doc starts with "logs"
-- update progress.md with brief session notes stating date and time
