🧾 2025-10-06 14:36 PDT — Retrieved transcript via Gong MCP tool

🧭 2025-10-06 14:50 PDT — Confirmed outlines/brief-adjacent fields available via API
- Our MCP `retrieve_transcripts` already requests `includeInteractionsSummary`, `includeEntities`, and `includeTrackers`, which cover outline/brief-like metadata.
- Next: expose a `get_call_brief` tool to return a compact brief object and add a script to persist briefs alongside transcripts.

📝 2025-10-06 14:58 PDT — Wrote MCP upgrade plan for briefs/outlines
- Added detailed plan in `gong/plan-mcp-upgrade.md` (tools, shapes, extraction strategy, scripts, acceptance criteria).

# PROGRESS REPORT

🧭 2025-10-06 11:28 PT — Drafted MCP v2 plan
- Wrote `gong/plan-mcp-v2.md` with MCP-first tools (search_calls, get_call_assets, health), logging, migration away from direct HTTP scripts, testing, and acceptance criteria.
🔎 2025-10-06 11:40 PT — Aligned plan with MCP docs
- Added lifecycle/capabilities, resources (with URI templates), prompts, notifications, content formats, and optional elicitation to `gong/plan-mcp-v2.md`.

🚀 2025-10-06 11:17 PDT — Built PowerPoint-style index2.html deck
- Created animated slide navigation with Magnite gradients and context-aware accents

🧰 2025-10-03 18:27 PDT — Added standard .gitignore for starter pack
- Included macOS, IDEs, Node/TS, Python, logs, and env patterns
- Documented notes in `outline-1002.md`

** EXAMPLE PROGRESS REPORT BELOW -- NEW REPORTS GO ABOVE, NEWEST ALWAYS AT TOP **

🧠 2025-10-06 18:20 PDT — Added Quick Cursor Setup for Gong MCP
- Updated `gong/gong-mcp/README.md` with beginner-friendly steps: fill `.env`, copy absolute paths for `dist/index.js` and `.env`, configure `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, reload Cursor, verify `health` tool, troubleshooting, and when to `npm install && npm run build`.
- Goal: enable teammates to run MCP in Cursor without build steps when `dist/` is present.

📝 2025-10-06 18:40 PDT — Simplified setup to use relative `.cursor/mcp.json`
- Updated README Quick Cursor Setup to remove absolute-path step; repo ships `.cursor/mcp.json` using `./gong/gong-mcp/dist/index.js` and `DOTENV_CONFIG_PATH=./gong/gong-mcp/.env`.
- Users now only need to create `.env` from `.env.example`, reload Cursor, and run `health`.

💾 2025-09-30 20:00 PT — Fixed catalog item edit cache issue
- Resolved item name/description edits reverting after save in menu builder
- Root cause: `updateCatalogItem` only revalidated `/admin/items`, not menu pages, so Next.js served stale cached menu data
- Added cache invalidation for `/admin/menus` and `/admin/menus/[id]` paths
- Changed error handling from silent return false to throwing (proper error propagation)
- Added emoji console logs (📝 updating, ✅ success, ❌ error) per repo standards
- Updated `lib/actions/items.ts`; documented in `docs/calls/email-0930.md`

- 2025-10-06 11:15 PT: Ran Gong MCP to generate brief and outline for DV360 call (7264530111852323899). Saved to `gong/transcripts/` and provided summary to user.

📝 2025-10-06 16:33 PDT — Clarified `.cursor` Git behavior and MCP portability
- Reviewed `.gitignore` and `.cursor/mcp.json`; confirmed `.cursor/` is not ignored by default
- Recommended relative paths in MCP config and ignoring `.env` while keeping `.env.example`
