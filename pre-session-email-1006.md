Subject: Monday 10/6 — AI‑native build workshop (setup + agenda)

Hi Anna, Garrett, and Justin,

Excited for Monday’s 2.5‑hour build workshop. The goal is simple: each of you will leave with a running MVP of an idea you care about — plus a repeatable process to keep shipping after I go.

TL;DR
- Bring one idea you want to prototype.
- Do the short machine prep before we meet (about 30–40 minutes total).
- We’ll build in parallel, then demo at the end.

When
- Date: Mon 10/6
- Time: 11:00 AM – 1:30 PM [timezone]
- Location: Zoom — [insert link]

Agenda
1) Framing (15 min): AI‑native mindset, context engineering, quick plan review.
2) Scope (30 min): Strip each idea to a 90‑minute MVP.
3) Build (90 min): Parallel builds in Cursor with Claude Code; I’ll rotate/troubleshoot.
4) Demos (15 min): Show what you built + next steps.

Pre‑work (please do before Monday)
1) Run the setup checklist in the attached README‑setup.md. It covers:
   - Homebrew, Xcode CLT
   - Node (LTS) + TypeScript
   - Python 3.12+
   - Java (JDK 21)
   - Git + GitHub auth (SSH or PAT via gh CLI)
   - Cursor installed
   - API keys you might need (Anthropic/OpenAI, Google, etc.)
2) Optional: If you have Magnite’s design deck, keep it handy. We’ll generate a simple style guide from it to keep UI coherent.

What to bring
- A one‑pager on your idea (problem, user, success signal for MVP)
- Any API keys/data you plan to use
- (Optional) Design deck or brand references

Output you can expect
- A working, minimal MVP per person
- A GitHub repo with your code
- A repeatable build loop in Cursor + Claude Code

If anything in the setup takes more than 10 minutes, just stop and reply here — I’ll help you unblock quickly.

Thanks!
