[4122:42] 2114087984175195171: Oh, I was going crazy.
[4178:22] 2114087984175195171: I couldn't focus on my work.
[4212:22] 2114087984175195171: I was trying to do it and I was just like what?
[4247:22] 2114087984175195171: And she's so like in love with them.

[4401:22] 2114087984175195171: There's one specific episode.
[4436:22] 2188256050097562170: Oh, wow.
[4451:02] 2114087984175195171: Only one episode that she can, any other episode.
[4500:22] 2114087984175195171: She starts crying immediately and it's like about clapping.
[4557:02] 2114087984175195171: And then she gets all of us to clap.
[4584:02] 2114087984175195171: I'm like how do you do this?
[4618:22] 2114087984175195171: Like being an uncle is way easier because I just come for like one hour.
[4691:42] 2114087984175195171: And then I'm gone.
[4724:12] 2188256050097562170: Did you say she's 10 months old?
[4760:32] 2114087984175195171: 10 months?
[4771:02] 2114087984175195171: Yeah.
[4777:02] 2114087984175195171: How?
[4781:42] 2188256050097562170: Is she so specific of like songs and TV shows already?
[4873:22] 2188256050097562170: I.
[4879:12] 2114087984175195171: Don't like know, she just starts crying like immediately because I didn't think anything of it.
[4967:12] 2114087984175195171: Honestly.
[4976:12] 2114087984175195171: I was putting on basketball highlights.
[5003:12] 2114087984175195171: I thought that would be fine.
[5024:52] 2114087984175195171: And then she started crying immediately.
[5063:32] 2114087984175195171: I was like, wait, you don't like the nba?
[5107:12] 2188256050097562170: Yeah, no, I mean, she's.
[5122:52] 2114087984175195171: very good.
[5128:32] 2114087984175195171: I thought that would be fine.
[5147:12] 2114087984175195171: Then I texted my sister.
[5161:52] 2114087984175195171: I was like, I put on bluey because I know about bluey, I heard.
[5218:32] 2114087984175195171: And then my sister like she started crying.
[5249:12] 2114087984175195171: I was like, she put on like season four episode seven on sesame street and then she was good.
[5350:52] 2114087984175195171: She was like right away, so happy.
[5395:12] 2114087984175195171: I think well, she's very close to my brother and me but I think for me because sometimes I wear glasses.
[5496:32] 2114087984175195171: Sometimes I'm wearing a hat.
[5517:52] 2114087984175195171: Sometimes I shave, I don't know if she's like if she thinks I'm two different people.
[5607:12] 2188256050097562170: Yeah.
[5629:12] 2114087984175195171: But it's cool.
[5656:52] 2114087984175195171: Though.
[5660:32] 2114087984175195171: It's cool over like I was off last week and we had an engagement here.
[5741:12] 2114087984175195171: So, all my cousins came from like Vancouver, england, California.
[5795:52] 2114087984175195171: And there were like so many kids at my house.
[5829:32] 2114087984175195171: It was like a daycare.
[5843:32] 2114087984175195171: We had like, I think we had three kids staying for the week.
[5916:32] 2114087984175195171: Oh my gosh.
[5932:52] 2114087984175195171: Yeah, it was cool though.
[5961:12] 2114087984175195171: It was fun, you know, because I was off too if I was working.
[6019:12] 2188256050097562170: Yeah, but I'm sure you were back when they left, yeah.
[6058:42] 2114087984175195171: Yeah, I was, but you feel a little lonely too because I didn't have a room, right?
[6157:02] 2114087984175195171: That was the only thing I gave them my room.
[6180:22] 2114087984175195171: So I was sleeping on the sofa, right?
[6219:02] 2114087984175195171: I kind of got kicked out, but overall, it's good.
[6286:22] 2114087984175195171: Yeah, like I'm kind of, I like being alone too.
[6356:12] 2188256050097562170: Yeah.
[6384:22] 2188256050097562170: I like that for you.
[6413:42] 2188256050097562170: I wish I could be an aunt.
[6463:22] 2114087984175195171: I think it's much easier.
[6506:42] 2114087984175195171: I think being an aunt being an uncle and an aunt is much easier.
[6566:22] 2188256050097562170: Oh, yes.
[6582:02] 2188256050097562170: Last night, my son like this morning, my son woke up at like 615 and he usually wakes up around like seven, 715 like he's pretty good.
[6761:02] 2188256050097562170: And my husband's traveling.
[6785:22] 2188256050097562170: So, I'm still parenting and he, like, I don't know what happened.
[6851:42] 2188256050097562170: Like he screamed like right away.
[6897:22] 2188256050097562170: And so I woke up like instantly and I was like, me, okay.
[6948:02] 2188256050097562170: It's my turn, you know, like when you wake up like there's a bomb coming to you.
[7039:22] 2114087984175195171: And it must be tough solo too.
[7078:02] 2114087984175195171: Yeah.
[7086:02] 2188256050097562170: Yeah, usually, my husband is like better than me of like waking up and stuff like that, but this one's like, okay, me, my job, I'm here.
[7249:02] 2188256050097562170: So, yeah, be the uncle Chetan that's the easiest.
[7320:22] 2114087984175195171: Be the uncle, like I just do one of these and then she's fine.
[7396:42] 2188256050097562170: Good for you.
[7416:22] 2188256050097562170: Oh my God.
[7436:42] 2188256050097562170: Hey guys.
[7466:02] 2188256050097562170: Good morning, everyone.
[7504:22] 2188256050097562170: Good morning.
[7551:12] 2188256050097562170: How are you?
[7616:02] 2114087984175195171: Not bad.
[7627:42] 2188256050097562170: Helen.
[7635:22] 2188256050097562170: You're muted early morning?
[7705:32] 2114087984175195171: Morning did not?
[7778:02] 2174463968188460547: Yeah, good.
[7785:02] 2174463968188460547: Happy Friday, everyone.
[7809:22] 2114087984175195171: I.
[7834:22] 2174463968188460547: guess we got a pretty agenda.
[7881:42] 2174463968188460547: So, I guess crave with prime that's priority for us.
[7932:22] 2174463968188460547: We're still trying to figure out the, getting it prioritized with Amazon to get the endpoints id that hopefully you sent and then also like clarify, do you need two endpoints one for English, one, for French?
[8168:02] 2174463968188460547: Like give us some guidance here?
[8200:22] 2174463968188460547: Yeah.
[8210:02] 2174463968188460547: And I,
[8236:42] 2188256050097562170: checked with the rogers and the course integration we had, and they were only English.
[8362:32] 2188256050097562170: So I don't have any other examples, okay of how we're going to be able to do that.
[8446:32] 2188256050097562170: Amazon will come back to us.
[8482:22] 2188256050097562170: Yeah.
[8490:42] 2174463968188460547: And you've only sent the endpoint you sent is English.
[8541:52] 2188256050097562170: It's not English or French.
[8576:42] 2188256050097562170: Right now.
[8584:22] 2188256050097562170: It's just one.
[8594:32] 2188256050097562170: So we can say whatever it is.
[8641:42] 2188256050097562170: Yeah.
[8659:12] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[8669:12] 2174463968188460547: So, yeah, more to come on that and then, oh, yeah.
[8731:12] 2174463968188460547: So can you kind of take us through?
[8769:52] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[8779:32] 2174463968188460547: So let's assume it's just one endpoint and what they have is, okay, they enable it whenever two weeks from now or a week from now, and then what's going to happen?
[8917:52] 2174463968188460547: Like, will you immediately see the crave inventory on prime within streaming?
[9022:12] 2188256050097562170: Yeah.
[9028:52] 2188256050097562170: Can you show Sophia on the account where you need that created?
[9099:42] 6422275571455599916: Yes.
[9112:32] 6422275571455599916: Let me show my screen.
[9304:32] 6422275571455599916: Do you see it?
[9320:32] 2188256050097562170: Yeah.
[9360:02] 2174463968188460547: Yeah.
[9391:32] 6422275571455599916: So it's here.
[9453:52] 4021414079536096426: And just a question on that.
[9476:12] 4021414079536096426: So I was looking at this, Sophia, and are we going to also have like the breakdown of like, no, or is it just going to be okay?
[9604:12] 4021414079536096426: So in terms of like targeting English or French, like it would just be obviously, we only want Ron, like we can't go any further than that.
[9718:12] 4021414079536096426: So if we do English or French, like we might need two separate like channels like one English, one, French.
[9818:32] 2188256050097562170: So that's one of the solutions I provided.
[9870:12] 2188256050097562170: So, Chantal, on this, you see the drawer on the thread with Amazon.
[9926:32] 2188256050097562170: Oh, okay.
[9940:12] 2188256050097562170: But the two options I gave is like we either create two channels which I don't think they're going to be able to do or one for French, one for English?
[10097:02] 2188256050097562170: Or we're going to be asking them to pass a custom parameter?
[10156:22] 2188256050097562170: Do you remember we used like C, one equal one zero for spring serve, we can do the same system and having them pass equal English or equal French.
[10310:22] 2188256050097562170: And then you're going to be using the targeting on your pmps?
[10355:42] 4021414079536096426: But then we would have to have that for all of the, because if we're combining the inventory on our other pmps, we would need all of the ad sources to have that as well.
[10487:32] 2188256050097562170: Yeah, all of the ad sources.
[10508:42] 2188256050097562170: Yes.
[10524:02] 2188256050097562170: And Sophia will help you like once we're there, let's know, you know, let's.
[10595:42] 4021414079536096426: Yeah, not worry about it yet.
[10618:42] 2188256050097562170: But once we're there, yeah, we've talked about it with Sophia yesterday and Caitlin from our team as well of how we're going to be able to like target within the ad sources and we have a solution.
[10801:02] 2188256050097562170: Okay?
[10809:42] 2188256050097562170: So, the keyness will be to have two channels crave Amazon PFC, PFC, French, and another one for English.
[10939:42] 2188256050097562170: But I don't know how it's set up in time.
[10996:02] 4021414079536096426: Okay.
[10999:02] 4021414079536096426: Because, yeah, that would be the cleanest in terms of like adding the inventory to the ad sources, then we could just add that channel.
[11093:12] 4021414079536096426: And then everything in that channel would apply.
[11145:12] 2188256050097562170: I wish, okay, yeah, waiting on Amazon on this one.
[11221:22] 2174463968188460547: How much effort then, once they get to set up like let's say it, is, they're able to split English and French.
[11320:12] 2174463968188460547: How much time do we need on our side to set up streaming?
[11394:22] 2188256050097562170: It's just updating the ad sources, right?
[11426:32] 2188256050097562170: Sophia.
[11440:42] 2188256050097562170: Yeah, I don't know.
[11470:42] 6422275571455599916: How much do you have I?
[11518:22] 2188256050097562170: Don't have many ad sources.
[11541:42] 2188256050097562170: Do you like 10 20?
[11592:32] 4021414079536096426: I think we have like 20.
[11636:22] 2174463968188460547: Oh, I see.
[11652:02] 2174463968188460547: But.
[11657:22] 4021414079536096426: We only like because we would only be adding it to our Ron.
[11703:42] 4021414079536096426: So, Ron, and maybe like Alan, I don't know, you tell me like would we be adding it to like our crave ros, as well?
[11823:42] 4021414079536096426: Maybe?
[11876:02] 2188256050097562170: But that.
[11888:02] 4021414079536096426: There's probably like 10 total, even if we include the crave?
[11957:22] 2174463968188460547: Yeah.
[11965:52] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[11972:52] 2174463968188460547: So that's all we're doing?
[11983:12] 2174463968188460547: We're just taking the springserve, what are they called?
[12029:12] 2174463968188460547: SS, blah, blah, blah, and adding them to the targeting within each ad source?
[12125:52] 2188256050097562170: The, what?
[12145:52] 2174463968188460547: What are they called in springserve?
[12168:52] 2174463968188460547: The… ask that, you know, though you just said, oh, the.
[12242:52] 6422275571455599916: C1 C2, oh, we.
[12268:12] 2188256050097562170: yeah.
[12296:32] 2174463968188460547: No, no, no, like go back to.
[12316:12] 2174463968188460547: Can you go back to springserve?
[12344:32] 6422275571455599916: Oh,
[12364:42] 4021414079536096426: you mean the channel?
[12382:52] 4021414079536096426: You mean like under the inventory, Alan?
[12417:32] 8255223483067911558: Inventory, yeah.
[12440:32] 2174463968188460547: There that.
[12456:52] 6422275571455599916: Yeah, yeah.
[12463:12] 4021414079536096426: Sorry, this isn't in springserve.
[12486:12] 4021414079536096426: Alan, this is in streaming.
[12514:12] 2174463968188460547: Oh, okay.
[12529:32] 4021414079536096426: All the same UI, but, yeah.
[12586:42] 2174463968188460547: That's in streaming.
[12599:12] 2174463968188460547: Okay?
[12609:32] 2188256050097562170: Don't get me wrong.
[12621:52] 2188256050097562170: I just found the old UI, which I'm not supposed to.
[12676:12] 2174463968188460547: Use there's.
[12678:02] 2174463968188460547: No springserve.
[12685:02] 2174463968188460547: I forgot.
[12693:22] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[12702:02] 2174463968188460547: Yeah, we'll basically be adding crave Amazon English and French to the appropriate ad sources.
[12812:42] 2188256050097562170: Yeah.
[12823:02] 2188256050097562170: Can you, can you just show quickly so Sophia, can you hover like, so not on the supply when you're on supply partners here, you're on springserve when you're on inventory, you're on streaming.
[13098:42] 2188256050097562170: Yeah.
[13128:52] 2188256050097562170: Okay.
[13138:52] 2188256050097562170: So the two uis are now combined in together.
[13196:12] 2188256050097562170: It looks the same but I know the toggle on the left is a bit confusing sometimes.
[13287:52] 2188256050097562170: So, yeah, we just need to, I think I'm going and I need to do a better job as well.
[13429:22] 6422275571455599916: Yeah, same for reporting.
[13449:12] 6422275571455599916: When you go to reporting, you have the reporting for springserve here.
[13517:52] 6422275571455599916: And then if you want to pull a report from streaming it's under magnite?
[13592:12] 6422275571455599916: Programmatic?
[13648:02] 2174463968188460547: Got it.
[13654:52] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[13745:02] 6422275571455599916: Yeah.
[13748:42] 6422275571455599916: So basically, we're just waiting for Amazon to come back on how we're going to integrate French and English.
[13890:42] 6422275571455599916: Yeah, go ahead.
[13914:42] 2174463968188460547: Yeah.
[13918:22] 2174463968188460547: And then I guess that was it.
[13952:42] 2174463968188460547: I guess for that one.
[13963:22] 2174463968188460547: So it'll be posted.
[14044:42] 6422275571455599916: I wanted to check with you chanu, about RDS wrapper.
[14178:42] 6422275571455599916: So it's fixed on desktop, but it's not fixed on mobile.
[14262:22] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[14295:22] 6422275571455599916: Thank you for fixing it for.
[14337:22] 6422275571455599916: Yeah.
[14357:42] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, I'll check.
[14386:22] 6422275571455599916: Yeah, TSN, it's fixed for both.
[14422:02] 6422275571455599916: Okay.
[14437:22] 6422275571455599916: It's just RDS and CTV obviously.
[14490:22] 8255223483067911558: Oh, CTV seems to be something else like it's not receiving any new requests.
[14584:32] 6422275571455599916: So, yeah.
[14603:42] 4021414079536096426: Okay.
[14631:22] 6422275571455599916: And I just wanted to let you know that the dashboard, the legacy dashboard is available.
[14729:32] 6422275571455599916: Now, you can see it.
[14770:42] 6422275571455599916: I can share my screen with you.
[14910:52] 6422275571455599916: Here.
[14917:32] 6422275571455599916: Do you see my DV plus?
[14958:52] 6422275571455599916: No?
[14973:52] 8255223483067911558: No.
[15216:02] 6422275571455599916: So, here and the dashboard you have now too, you have the new one that you don't like.
[15304:42] 6422275571455599916: And then you have to, I,
[15342:02] 8255223483067911558: don't have it.
[15357:22] 8255223483067911558: You?
[15385:32] 6422275571455599916: Don't have it.
[15397:22] 8255223483067911558: No.
[15474:02] 6422275571455599916: Did you check today?
[15490:02] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[15500:02] 8255223483067911558: Just now?
[15581:32] 6422275571455599916: Okay.
[15592:12] 6422275571455599916: Let me check with the team.
[15634:02] 8255223483067911558: Or maybe I'll try logging out and then try again?
[15682:32] 6422275571455599916: Yeah, maybe let me know.
[15818:42] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[15824:42] 8255223483067911558: It's there.
[15845:22] 6422275571455599916: It's there.
[15854:22] 6422275571455599916: Oh, perfect.
[15878:22] 8255223483067911558: Thank you.
[15915:42] 6422275571455599916: Also, I've sent you the bid request you've asked for, remember for the app that was sending like a weird bundle.
[16117:42] 6422275571455599916: Yeah, you have it.
[16131:02] 6422275571455599916: You received it.
[16199:32] 2174463968188460547: I.
[16200:32] 8255223483067911558: think you sent it to programmatic?
[16242:22] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[16257:02] 6422275571455599916: Let me.
[16263:02] 8255223483067911558: Find it.
[16312:32] 6422275571455599916: Don't worry.
[16319:32] 6422275571455599916: I just want to make sure you have it so you can give it to your dev team.
[16416:02] 8255223483067911558: Sure.
[16458:42] 4021414079536096426: I just wanted to let you know.
[16481:22] 4021414079536096426: I do see, the old, like the two dashboards as well.
[16528:42] 4021414079536096426: So maybe like the DV plus dashboards, I see both of them.
[16617:02] 4021414079536096426: So, yeah, you see it now?
[16658:22] 4021414079536096426: Yeah.
[16668:42] 6422275571455599916: Okay.
[16690:02] 8255223483067911558: Once I logged out and logged in, I can see.
[16777:32] 6422275571455599916: Great.
[16811:12] 6422275571455599916: Any updates on PNG deals?
[16854:32] 6422275571455599916: I don't see any bids so far.
[16943:12] 6422275571455599916: No, I think.
[16983:32] 2174463968188460547: They're Walter's still with their us team.
[17032:52] 2174463968188460547: I know this was like a fire under everybody and all of a sudden they're not even spending even though they have the preferred deals.
[17125:32] 2174463968188460547: So we're waiting to.
[17168:02] 6422275571455599916: All right.
[17186:22] 6422275571455599916: Okay.
[17235:22] 6422275571455599916: Last thing I had, I can see there's a drop in cadence inventory in terms of impressions.
[17447:42] 6422275571455599916: I think since the first of October, if you can check if there's like… something on cadence platform?
[17707:42] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[17711:42] 8255223483067911558: So yesterday, when I pulled the report, I saw less number of requests for first of October… but I thought it was just a reporting delay.
[17920:22] 8255223483067911558: I was checking something else, but we'll check.
[18034:02] 6422275571455599916: Okay.
[18137:32] 6422275571455599916: Alan, do you want to talk about the content channel?
[18188:42] 2174463968188460547: Yeah, Julia, forgetting checking that out, but I don't know if you want to chime in, but we, you confirm basically the ad unit is being filled in for content channel and we can't mess around with that ad unit too much.
[18411:12] 2174463968188460547: Otherwise, the mapping will get messed up.
[18464:52] 2174463968188460547: So, if we try to change content channel or channel to something that we want it to be in the bid request… from what we can see, there's no way to do that.
[18655:12] 2174463968188460547: Like we say we wanted to change the channel to crave… all the time.
[18770:52] 2174463968188460547: Is there a way to do that?
[18813:32] 2174463968188460547: Or do we have to wait for openrtb two point six where it's not an extension because last time you showed it was an extension in two point five… whereas we'll have to wait for content channel to be a real object in two point six.
[19201:42] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[19269:42] 2174463968188460547: We can barely hear you.
[19401:32] 2188256050097562170: Looks like you're underwater, Julia, like maybe your headphones are connected somewhere and the microphone is very far away or?
[19606:22] 8255223483067911558: We don't hear you.
[19616:42] 2188256050097562170: At all now.
[19840:02] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[19845:52] 8255223483067911558: In the meantime, Chantal, so we have the PG supply tax located, right?
[19926:12] 8255223483067911558: Is that for finecast?
[19982:52] 4021414079536096426: Yeah, those ones are finecast?
[20005:12] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[20013:32] 8255223483067911558: So it is sending requests but no response from the buy side.
[20109:12] 4021414079536096426: Alan, do we know if finecast has any?
[20159:52] 2174463968188460547: Oh, maybe, I can ask Amanda.
[20232:12] 2174463968188460547: It usually takes them a couple days at the beginning of each month to like get going.
[20348:42] 2174463968188460547: Okay?
[20358:22] 2174463968188460547: So, so, sorry to know there's no fine cast delivery.
[20420:22] 2174463968188460547: Nope.
[20436:22] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[20501:22] 8255223483067911558: And also, yes.
[20520:42] 8255223483067911558: So, the number of requests from Kaden dropped a lot, but.
[20673:42] 6422275571455599916: I can see the drop on the impressions like we're at like minus 70 percent from, yeah.
[20890:42] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[20894:02] 8255223483067911558: So this is the PG finecast, like there is no response from the buyer, but for this one, the number of requests also dropped.
[21097:02] 8255223483067911558: So, if you're Sophia, if you're checking the router level, that includes the PG, as well.
[21179:02] 8255223483067911558: So then you will see the drop in the number of impressions.
[21238:22] 6422275571455599916: Yeah.
[21261:52] 8255223483067911558: But, yeah.
[21376:02] 8255223483067911558: We really didn't do anything.
[21402:02] 8255223483067911558: So I'll check on Kaden as well to see if they are, if the number of requests sent from Kaden is matching with what we are receiving in spring cert… if it is matching, then it's about, you know, the sell through of the direct campaigns.
[21714:02] 6422275571455599916: All right.
[21809:02] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[21844:12] 6422275571455599916: Hi, Julia.
[21869:52] 368407373435503627: Can you hear me now?
[21885:02] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[21909:22] 6422275571455599916: I.
[21955:42] 368407373435503627: don't know what happened?
[21980:02] 368407373435503627: You know, sometimes it's like my phone connects automatically to the computer and then I think it's trying to use my phone microphone or something.
[22161:02] 368407373435503627: But yeah, I don't know if that was the case anyways.
[22299:02] 368407373435503627: So, we were talking about channel… and you said that it's… not possible to change the request to spring serve.
[22534:42] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, I don't know.
[22548:42] 8255223483067911558: Shanu, can you expand on that as you mentioned… Julia?
[22682:42] 8255223483067911558: If you're adding a new parameter to capture the content channel from gam to spring serve, then we need a macro override to get that value passed through the bid request, right?
[22905:22] 8255223483067911558: We tried to do that macro override.
[22985:22] 8255223483067911558: So we don't have that content channel as a parameter in the dropdown list?
[23076:12] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[23098:32] 8255223483067911558: So, then how are we going to do that?
[23241:02] 368407373435503627: So, you're saying that you cannot pass in the same, what… are you passing in the Tana… not the channel you're passing in right now in the request, let me just go back to the request.
[23550:12] 368407373435503627: Maybe we can see it better… what you're passing in right now in terms of our keys One second?
[23769:12] 8255223483067911558: I'm opening it.
[23783:32] 8255223483067911558: Okay?
[23861:12] 368407373435503627: Let me see.
[24100:12] 8255223483067911558: So currently, we are passing only channel name equals the add unit from gam, right?
[24223:32] 368407373435503627: So,
[24233:32] 8255223483067911558: this is the same value we are seeing in the outgoing bid request as the content channel.
[24349:32] 368407373435503627: Okay.
[24361:12] 368407373435503627: Would you be able to pass in another key?
[24450:32] 368407373435503627: Any name of the key with the same add unit?
[24518:12] 368407373435503627: You know?
[24543:52] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, I can do that.
[24573:42] 8255223483067911558: For example, I can add something like the content underscore channel equals this add unit.
[24691:12] 368407373435503627: Right, right.
[24704:02] 368407373435503627: That will.
[24713:32] 8255223483067911558: Pull the value that will pull the value of add unit.
[24755:32] 368407373435503627: You can just pass add unit equal and add unit, and you pass add unit.
[24848:02] 368407373435503627: And then what we're going to do is we're going to create an add unit key.
[24916:22] 368407373435503627: And instead of targeting on the channel on the supply tag, we're going to target on that key.
[25014:32] 368407373435503627: And when the key is passed in and then, so that the channel is not going to be targeted on the channel name right now, is it, hold on when you pass in the channel name?
[25346:22] 368407373435503627: Okay?
[25360:42] 368407373435503627: Let's… see.
[25537:02] 368407373435503627: in the meanwhile, you can do that.
[25580:42] 368407373435503627: If you can do that, then I can set it up… set the key up.
[25714:02] 368407373435503627: Let's see all the targeting that we have right now.
[25760:22] 8255223483067911558: So, what's the parameter you want me to use?
[25790:22] 8255223483067911558: It should be add unit or something else?
[25851:22] 368407373435503627: Yes, add unit.
[25893:02] 368407373435503627: Okay.
[25903:02] 368407373435503627: Just pass in add unit, equal add unit.
[25956:22] 368407373435503627: Perfect.
[25968:02] 368407373435503627: Yes, exactly like that.
[26033:22] 368407373435503627: Then basically, we're instead of seeing getting targeted on the channel, which is that long string and it cannot be overridden.
[26220:22] 368407373435503627: We're going to target a channel on the add unit value, and then we're going to override the channel when you receive that add unit.
[26432:12] 368407373435503627: Okay, I can explain you.
[26463:52] 368407373435503627: So why don't you just say go into keys and add an add unit key?
[26587:42] 8255223483067911558: Sure.
[26651:42] 368407373435503627: So, if you want to show me what you're doing?
[26720:12] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, for sure.
[26734:12] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, I'll do it one second.
[27090:02] 368407373435503627: So, yeah, you can add one.
[27234:02] 368407373435503627: And it can be free.
[27254:42] 368407373435503627: It doesn't have to be predefined.
[27287:22] 368407373435503627: So you can hit apply.
[27339:22] 368407373435503627: So now, let's go back to the supply tag that we want to override the channel for.
[27487:02] 368407373435503627: I don't know if we want to override for all, but we can just example one, sure.
[27836:42] 368407373435503627: Let's look on to that one.
[27863:02] 368407373435503627: And so set a key value targeting.
[27913:22] 368407373435503627: So we're going into targeting… and instead of like having content channel targeting, we're going to just eliminate that and we're going to just set an add unit, targeting.
[28115:42] 368407373435503627: Yeah, where does that end?
[28140:02] 368407373435503627: And instead of like you put contains and then that value… that you're passing in.
[28291:42] 368407373435503627: So what is it going to be for this particular?
[28374:42] 8255223483067911558: Oh, okay.
[28403:42] 8255223483067911558: So that's the problem here, right?
[28433:42] 8255223483067911558: So we are pulling, I mean, we are using one tag, for example, a third second tag to pull the values.
[28564:42] 8255223483067911558: Sorry, get the request from all our content properties.
[28633:22] 8255223483067911558: Like it can be CTV, CTV news or TSN or whatever.
[28728:32] 368407373435503627: Right.
[28734:22] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[28765:02] 368407373435503627: In content channel, you're receiving add unit and you're like targeting on, so contains the CTV Amazon fire that's a channel.
[28944:12] 368407373435503627: So, can you go back into targeting the big one targeting?
[29023:32] 368407373435503627: Sorry, we can leave that like that for, but let's go into target, which is in more.
[29160:32] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[29193:32] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[29213:12] 368407373435503627: The older, yeah… it's fine.
[29285:22] 368407373435503627: So… I'm just… going to get more and then targeting like, so, so right now, if you're going to channel, sorry, parameter list under list, you got the, all the, yeah.
[29628:42] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[29637:42] 8255223483067911558: So.
[29658:42] 368407373435503627: Let's click on that one.
[29717:42] 368407373435503627: So basically, this one is targeting all of these channel, huh, right?
[29811:22] 368407373435503627: So you could just say copy this list.
[29956:12] 368407373435503627: I see what you mean.
[29979:52] 368407373435503627: Then we're gonna have to create a key specific for this, add unit values, yeah.
[30125:12] 8255223483067911558: For example, like if it's for CTV Amazon fire, then we should be passing some value, something like.
[30294:22] 368407373435503627: Yeah, or about value list, you can just create a keys with a value list.
[30376:02] 368407373435503627: So in the keys, just copy, those values into a list, those ones that you have in the channel.
[30550:32] 8255223483067911558: So,
[30594:12] 368407373435503627: if you can, yeah, maybe.
[30650:52] 8255223483067911558: So this is, I don't think this is ideal because like, you know, we don't want to pass something this one as the content channel, right?
[30793:52] 8255223483067911558: We want to.
[30801:12] 368407373435503627: So that's why we're gonna just target on this value, but pass a different value in content.
[30915:52] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[30932:12] 8255223483067911558: So.
[30966:12] 368407373435503627: Then, yeah, like in targeting in not, you can just put values and… then add those.
[31148:52] 368407373435503627: I don't know if you can.
[31171:32] 368407373435503627: Otherwise, it's better to create a list.
[31209:32] 368407373435503627: So to create a list, you have to go back into targeting into the ad unit… the keys.
[31466:32] 368407373435503627: And then just add a value list.
[31539:32] 368407373435503627: Okay?
[31550:12] 368407373435503627: And then plus value list.
[31582:52] 368407373435503627: Okay?
[31616:52] 368407373435503627: And then just add all of these values here.
[31677:12] 368407373435503627: Buyer.
[31690:12] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[31790:52] 368407373435503627: The one that you just copied, paste… them, so.
[31881:42] 8255223483067911558: That I can.
[31899:42] 368407373435503627: Face them like that, but otherwise, you can download them as CSV from the previous one and then append it as a CSV into this one.
[32094:22] 368407373435503627: So.
[32273:02] 368407373435503627: Yeah, download the list and then you can choose a perfect.
[32438:42] 368407373435503627: And then you hit apply.
[32516:12] 368407373435503627: Now, hopefully it's gonna like that.
[32614:12] 368407373435503627: But then we go back here.
[32654:52] 368407373435503627: And now once you, that is values you just put like… in the targeting, yes, Google custom add… unit again and then value list.
[32905:12] 368407373435503627: And then you just select this value list.
[32958:12] 368407373435503627: Okay?
[32963:32] 368407373435503627: Now you can eliminate that content targeting there.
[33020:52] 368407373435503627: So just like when it says content attribute group, the content targeting now, we're targeting on the key, we're not targeting on channel.
[33171:52] 368407373435503627: So you can just click the X on top of that.
[33239:22] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[33243:52] 8255223483067911558: Or?
[33253:02] 368407373435503627: All just, you see where it's content in all customs.
[33310:42] 368407373435503627: Yes.
[33317:52] 368407373435503627: So now you just hit apply.
[33373:52] 368407373435503627: This is gonna go production.
[33406:52] 368407373435503627: So hopefully this is gonna work.
[33480:12] 368407373435503627: So hit apply.
[33500:52] 368407373435503627: And then now you can write the override on… the content settings.
[33616:32] 368407373435503627: So here now you can override the content channel to the channel that you want.
[33889:02] 8255223483067911558: Content.
[33935:42] 368407373435503627: So, is it chat channel or just write channel?
[34010:42] 368407373435503627: Because it might be channel name instead of cottage, yes, channel name, and then just put the value that you want to pass?
[34235:42] 8255223483067911558: No.
[34238:42] 8255223483067911558: So this is what I was talking about.
[34284:42] 8255223483067911558: So we don't want to put a specific value here, right?
[34346:42] 8255223483067911558: It should be based on the traffic, for example, like, you know, is CTV… CTV traffic.
[34488:42] 368407373435503627: Let's see.
[34501:22] 368407373435503627: Okay.
[34519:22] 368407373435503627: I thought you just didn't want to pass the full thing.
[34572:02] 368407373435503627: No, no, no, yeah.
[34616:02] 8255223483067911558: So, yeah.
[34625:22] 8255223483067911558: So, we knew this part, but yeah, so that was not satisfying our requirement.
[34742:22] 368407373435503627: I see what you mean?
[34830:12] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[34987:42] 368407373435503627: Let me think about.
[35001:02] 368407373435503627: I'm just thinking like maybe you could split the value somehow, but I don't think we can do that in spring serve because… of the ad unit, you just want to pass a piece, right?
[35247:42] 368407373435503627: Of that ad unit id or because?
[35314:52] 8255223483067911558: It can be an ad unit, or it can be something else like for example, like if you want to pass something like a show name or something which is kind of dynamic.
[35466:32] 8255223483067911558: So we don't have.
[35490:32] 368407373435503627: This only for this supply.
[35511:52] 8255223483067911558: No, for everything all.
[35559:52] 368407373435503627: Of the supply.
[35569:52] 368407373435503627: So like all of them are targeting all content channel lists, not just on one content channel, correct?
[35800:32] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[35803:12] 368407373435503627: Okay.
[35822:52] 8255223483067911558: So for now, I'm gonna reward.
[35851:12] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[35870:52] 368407373435503627: Yeah, just revert and because if it was like maybe just one channel, then we could create one key for each one and then create, but that will create a supply for each one, which it's a pain.
[36092:32] 368407373435503627: I think it should be unfortunately worked at the origin.
[36238:12] 368407373435503627: Yeah, I don't think there's any manipulation that we can do on that ad uni string that you pass in, you know, on our side to… just, or, yeah, because… the if is gonna just override one channel.
[36514:52] 368407373435503627: Yeah… I don't… yeah, no.
[36701:52] 368407373435503627: Yeah, I just, so it was my bad.
[36736:12] 368407373435503627: I just thought you didn't want to pass the full string, but the channel was going to be the same, no.
[36895:52] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[36964:32] 8255223483067911558: All right.
[36974:12] 8255223483067911558: So, I made changes.
[37015:32] 8255223483067911558: So I'm still trying to see what we can do here.
[37086:52] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[37177:32] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[37179:32] 2174463968188460547: Sounds good.
[37195:12] 2174463968188460547: I guess Julia, you think of anything else?
[37228:32] 2174463968188460547: And so we've never had it correct.
[37260:52] 2174463968188460547: So this is, this would be a great win for us if we can get the channel corrected.
[37316:52] 2174463968188460547: Yeah.
[37370:32] 368407373435503627: Unfortunately, we don't have multiple override like based on the value, it would be cool, but I don't think it's gonna come anytime soon.
[37629:42] 368407373435503627: I mean, I could have a proposal for a product thing, but it could be complicated.
[37710:42] 368407373435503627: It could be complicated.
[37792:42] 2188256050097562170: I'm working on like product requests for spring surf, Julia, can we sync on slack after?
[37936:22] 368407373435503627: And.
[37943:02] 2188256050097562170: see… like if it's possible, not possible, like how much would it require according to you?
[38056:12] 2188256050097562170: And then I can push because I'm pushing a couple of requests for a Canadian market.
[38138:32] 2188256050097562170: Okay?
[38168:12] 8255223483067911558: So, guys, one more question I have regarding the same topic.
[38366:52] 8255223483067911558: Second.
[38694:22] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[38704:02] 8255223483067911558: Because after five minutes, I still need to pull some data, for that discussion.
[38770:02] 8255223483067911558: So give me a few minutes.
[38794:22] 8255223483067911558: We can discuss something else in the meantime.
[38839:42] 368407373435503627: And this is not something that you can capture from, you know, the content channel from, before it hits gam, like it's not something that will be possible to pass on to gam… or do it just.
[39156:12] 8255223483067911558: What do you mean like?
[39204:12] 368407373435503627: The content information, like I see that right now, you're passing in that ad unit, but there's no way to capture that and send it to before like capture that before it hits gam?
[39500:42] 8255223483067911558: Once it hits gam, that's when I'm able to pull that information once it hits gam, that's when I'm able to pull those values through some macros?
[39725:52] 368407373435503627: Right.
[39747:42] 368407373435503627: But the original request, the original request that goes into gam, right?
[39858:22] 368407373435503627: What does it look like?
[39940:02] 368407373435503627: What?
[39980:42] 8255223483067911558: Does it look?
[39987:02] 368407373435503627: Like, can you pass me the gam ad unit setup like the URL that you call in the springserve URL?
[40158:52] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[40409:32] 368407373435503627: Okay.
[40419:02] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[40458:22] 368407373435503627: Let's see.
[40497:42] 368407373435503627: So, for example, when you do tag parameter correlator or tag from something else or pattern, so that content rating, you're able to get it from your request, incoming request to gam, right?
[40798:02] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[40820:12] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, true.
[40839:52] 8255223483067911558: So, I will give an example here since I had CP 24 in my system.
[40961:52] 8255223483067911558: I'm sharing this one.
[40981:32] 8255223483067911558: So, this is the request… this is the request to gam.
[41085:52] 368407373435503627: Right.
[41108:22] 8255223483067911558: All these parameters?
[41138:22] 368407373435503627: Can you send me that too?
[41169:42] 368407373435503627: I don't know if it's possible to send via message, might be too long, but maybe by email, if it doesn't paste all of it, oh.
[41323:22] 8255223483067911558: It, it worked.
[41358:52] 368407373435503627: It worked.
[41368:02] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[41374:42] 368407373435503627: Okay.
[41382:42] 368407373435503627: Great.
[41397:02] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, which is?
[41430:22] 368407373435503627: Great.
[41436:02] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[41445:22] 8255223483067911558: If you see here what all the parameters we are seeing in the browser that's what?
[41520:42] 8255223483067911558: Like, you know, I was able to get that into springserve content type, yeah, rating and stuff, right?
[41666:42] 8255223483067911558: So, anything showing here, I can get that to springserve through some macros from gam?
[41813:02] 368407373435503627: Yes.
[41827:22] 368407373435503627: And why is it content channel is not something that you're able to?
[41935:52] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[41940:12] 8255223483067911558: So, if, for example, if I wanna share content channel as like CP 24 live, yes, I can do it.
[42053:12] 8255223483067911558: But in springserve that's my question.
[42161:32] 8255223483067911558: So, in springserve, we, we're currently not passing content underscore channel, in the springserve tag, but if you see the outgoing bid request?
[42652:42] 8255223483067911558: See content channel.
[42673:02] 8255223483067911558: So, this is like, we are not passing this information at all.
[42719:42] 8255223483067911558: Like then how come springserve is creating this value and copying?
[42829:42] 8255223483067911558: What are the value we are passing through channel?
[42901:22] 8255223483067911558: Adding it here.
[42941:52] 368407373435503627: Hold on… because you're passing channel name that unit into channel name, and that's how we populate content channel.
[43147:42] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[43154:22] 8255223483067911558: So, if I wanna have a new value here for example, abc?
[43262:52] 368407373435503627: Yeah, you just pass abc into channel underscore name?
[43341:52] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[43348:02] 8255223483067911558: So, for example, if I'm using this parameter in the springserve tag?
[43438:52] 368407373435503627: That doesn't work.
[43457:02] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[43467:42] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[43477:22] 8255223483067911558: That's what my question is.
[43519:52] 368407373435503627: It's it has to be channel name, and then it's gonna pass as content channel.
[43658:32] 8255223483067911558: So, there is no way to have two values, two separate values for these two, right?
[43763:02] 368407373435503627: Right.
[43851:42] 368407373435503627: Why, why did you wanna, is that how it's supposed to be?
[43913:22] 368407373435503627: Is that supposed to be?
[43944:22] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, Alan, can you explain that part?
[43972:42] 8255223483067911558: Like, you know, because I remember you had some examples like, you know, the discovery and stuff.
[44033:22] 2174463968188460547: Yeah, like channel should not be that long string.
[44096:42] 2174463968188460547: It should be, this is CTV news.
[44156:02] 2174463968188460547: This should be CTV news as the channel.
[44229:02] 2174463968188460547: I guess if we're talking about.
[44249:12] 368407373435503627: That's why I didn't understand that it was not supposed to be just a long string.
[44333:52] 2174463968188460547: Yeah, it's supposed to be for dsps, cuz they're like, oh, well, what channel am I buying with bell media, right?
[44459:32] 368407373435503627: But if you don't want it to be that strong long string instead of like that ad unit, in the channel name, you pass a shorter string like some like the actual content channel.
[44711:02] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[44723:22] 8255223483067911558: So, if, for example, in here, if I change.
[44904:22] 368407373435503627: If you change the channel name to one, two three, you're gonna pass one, two three into those two.
[44993:22] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[45003:42] 8255223483067911558: So if I make, any changes here, for example, like I wanna pass channel underscore, name equals to CTV news.
[45125:42] 8255223483067911558: So then how spring service gonna capture those requests and put it into these supply tags?
[45223:02] 8255223483067911558: Because if you remember like we had that parameter list for each of our properties like CTV news, CTV, Amazon, fire like that.
[45374:12] 8255223483067911558: So based on those content, sorry, based on the ad unit… spring service, bucketing those requests.
[45547:42] 368407373435503627: Right, right.
[45564:52] 368407373435503627: So, you would have to re, redo the targeting to make it.
[45677:12] 368407373435503627: So the channel name targeting is not the… it's on a list that has those new values.
[45858:02] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[45863:52] 8255223483067911558: So that, which means like that's a whole change for all our supply tags.
[45949:52] 368407373435503627: How many supplies it, that you would need to change?
[46021:52] 368407373435503627: I mean, we could that like do that via the API.
[46077:32] 368407373435503627: I could probably do that.
[46156:32] 368407373435503627: Where is that?
[46199:52] 368407373435503627: Like if no, that's a lot,
[46279:02] 8255223483067911558: And plus, like we have the same kind of setup for all our routers, it's not just well, media router, like we have the same setup for?
[46468:12] 368407373435503627: Yeah, it's… gonna be a bit involved.
[46533:32] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[46550:52] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[46558:32] 2174463968188460547: So.
[46562:52] 368407373435503627: What you could do though… is we could, you know, change and so, so if to not mess anything because of course, if you do this and then something goes wrong, if we could like just kind of like target… on the keys instead of on the channel.
[46992:42] 368407373435503627: So that now, like we have everything on the keys, the audio need on the keys.
[47080:02] 368407373435503627: And then… and then in the meanwhile, we can redo the channel, target the channel targeting.
[47194:32] 368407373435503627: I don't know, but it's yeah, it's gonna be pretty involved but I can definitely help with some bulk changes via the API.
[47336:12] 368407373435503627: We can figure this out for sure.
[47394:12] 368407373435503627: Yeah, to.
[47416:52] 8255223483067911558: Pass.
[47424:32] 368407373435503627: In the actual channel name that you want to be transferred to content channel and sent out.
[47513:32] 368407373435503627: We're gonna, we're gonna be able to make it work to pass it into.
[47607:22] 8255223483067911558: Got it.
[47615:52] 8255223483067911558: So we will take this back and then we'll analyze taking how much effort and how much important this signal is.
[47716:12] 8255223483067911558: And then we'll make an analysis and we'll decide if you want to go ahead with this.
[47782:32] 368407373435503627: Sounds good.
[47797:42] 368407373435503627: Yeah, yeah.
[47836:22] 2188256050097562170: Yeah, it's important that we try and find a fixed area.
[47920:22] 2188256050097562170: So if you need any request for this, you let me know because when I'm asking, I'm assuming Alan, the industry is really trying to get a better sense of the signals and they are going to be buying on this.
[48118:42] 2188256050097562170: So that's the step back.
[48167:02] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[48176:02] 368407373435503627: And by the way, support for like the certain, I think I don't know if like actual streaming is gonna, is supporting two point six right now, but for certain other demand, we are going to be able to support two point six signals.
[48488:22] 2188256050097562170: Yeah, it's coming.
[48507:22] 2188256050097562170: Yeah.
[48516:02] 368407373435503627: Yeah, it's coming.
[48548:32] 368407373435503627: Yeah, I don't know the timeline for streaming, but there is going to be pretty soon.
[48685:42] 2174463968188460547: We can table this for now until we figure out a solution.
[48735:12] 2174463968188460547: I can just push back and say we're working on a.
[48781:32] 368407373435503627: Solution and I'll send you an email about it.
[48871:52] 368407373435503627: So, and then, we can just figure out the, yeah, all the steps for the solution.
[49019:02] 2174463968188460547: We can redo every single supply tag though.
[49070:22] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, it's like super confusing.
[49095:02] 8255223483067911558: Trust me, it's super confusing with all these supply tags and things here.
[49192:12] 8255223483067911558: We, I mean, I get confused very easily like just looking into, you know, just for CTV, we have a lot of different supplies.
[49311:22] 8255223483067911558: And then again, like Chantal, like, you know, the new crave thing is coming.
[49370:02] 8255223483067911558: So it's like, I think like 2000 more than it needs to be mapped.
[49448:32] 2174463968188460547: Which we haven't even really mentioned yet, but coming down the way is great expansion is… going to… be requiring like a lot of new ad units, on our side that have to be mapped in.
[49734:32] 368407373435503627: This thing is a spring serve can always pass through those signals, you know, so like the real differentiator, what is it like in terms of setup?
[50002:22] 368407373435503627: You know?
[50009:42] 368407373435503627: So, so if you're passing, so right now, you're targeting on the channel, but why are you targeting on the channel?
[50182:22] 8255223483067911558: Like why are we targeting on the channel?
[50232:32] 368407373435503627: Is it because you have different demand that goes to each channel?
[50313:22] 368407373435503627: Because if the demand is not different from channel to channel then it don't need to target on the channel.
[50433:02] 368407373435503627: So, no.
[50455:02] 8255223483067911558: So, how are identities created in gam?
[50517:22] 8255223483067911558: It's in a specific structure like, you know, there's a platform then device, something for example, like in a CTV, the ad unit is like CTV underscore, CTV, underscore, desktop underscore, something.
[50796:12] 8255223483067911558: So we have specific ad units for each of our platform, each of our devices.
[50881:12] 8255223483067911558: It does.
[50892:32] 368407373435503627: Make sense to separate like desktops from CTV of course, because also streaming has… different demand for it.
[51091:42] 368407373435503627: I mean, it just like it makes sense to separate when you have like different demands.
[51184:02] 368407373435503627: So like streaming like… depending on your streaming setup, but I don't know if it does make sense to have different demand, like if you have different demand based on the channel, because right now, is that what you're targeting?
[51480:52] 8255223483067911558: Yes, yes, we have different demands based on the channels, for example, like we have Lg demand and for example, omg.
[51610:32] 8255223483067911558: So they are specifically buying oil, V or connected TV or fast?
[51726:52] 8255223483067911558: We wanted to have separate supplies.
[51785:32] 368407373435503627: Right, right.
[51809:52] 368407373435503627: But can you, so, so can you maybe combine certain channels that have the same demand to have like less supply tags or do you based on?
[52071:32] 8255223483067911558: The demand I don't think we should be, you know, grouping or separating it, right?
[52159:12] 8255223483067911558: Because demand can change anytime they can be new demand come in the future or, yeah.
[52296:12] 368407373435503627: I.
[52320:32] 8255223483067911558: don't know.
[52335:12] 8255223483067911558: So how can we group it?
[52376:32] 368407373435503627: Yeah, because basically, what differentiate each?
[52430:42] 368407373435503627: Like what differentiating supply tag is the demand that is attached to it?
[52504:42] 368407373435503627: Basically.
[52524:32] 368407373435503627: So if you have like you, it makes sense to have a different supply.
[52591:02] 368407373435503627: If you have different demand that you're going to attach to it.
[52661:42] 368407373435503627: Basically, that's the only reason.
[52722:52] 368407373435503627: So, let's say you have like three channels, you know, three, three channels but all of them would have the same demand.
[52915:12] 368407373435503627: Then you can have one supply tunnel tag because the channel information can be passed through, you know?
[53066:32] 4021414079536096426: I think we had split everything like in spring serve because for reporting purposes, if.
[53155:32] 368407373435503627: it's just for reporting purposes.
[53207:32] 368407373435503627: I don't think he's that important because you can run a report by channel.
[53299:32] 368407373435503627: The only difference is that there is no channel and key, but I don't think you're using a lot of keys.
[53436:52] 368407373435503627: So, so channel and key reporting, that is different.
[53527:02] 368407373435503627: But like maybe if you're if it's just for reporting, I would say let's try to simplify and not target on channels.
[53758:52] 368407373435503627: Because you can run a report by channel name in spring serve.
[53857:12] 368407373435503627: I mean, it's good maybe at the like when you just don't have a lot.
[53938:52] 368407373435503627: But since you guys have a lot then that's not.
[53991:12] 8255223483067911558: We have, a lot.
[54044:32] 8255223483067911558: I know.
[54097:52] 4021414079536096426: That the like Shannon, we had split it this way because that's what inventory had requested from us.
[54179:32] 4021414079536096426: Like if there's a better way to report on it, yeah, we explore that, but like we like it was specifically requested that they wanted everything split from our inventory team and like because they're the ones pulling all the reporting out of like, our consolidated reporting and everything.
[54437:42] 368407373435503627: If.
[54445:02] 4021414079536096426: there's a better way to report on it.
[54491:42] 4021414079536096426: Like if we can have it consolidated and still get all the information that they need.
[54558:52] 368407373435503627: Then we have some reports that they like need to run.
[54633:02] 368407373435503627: Can, can you gave me those reports that they run?
[54689:22] 368407373435503627: And I just see if you can do it without a targeting because certainly, it's true that in spring serve like you cannot report on certain dimension with other dimensions, you know?
[54913:02] 368407373435503627: So that's why?
[54930:42] 368407373435503627: Like if you're like reporting by content channel, you're not going to be able to report on keys at the same time.
[55040:02] 368407373435503627: But if they're not running this report, then there is no need to have like that separation… you know, like let's say like they are able to instead run a key report and a channel report.
[55294:22] 368407373435503627: And that's not going to be a big deal.
[55331:02] 368407373435503627: Then maybe we should, we can simplify the setup.
[55474:02] 368407373435503627: So, if you can send me, some reporting so that they run, then… I can see and we can discuss and see like we can.
[55687:22] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[55766:22] 8255223483067911558: Sure.
[55814:22] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[55858:02] 6422275571455599916: Sorry to interrupt.
[55900:02] 6422275571455599916: So group M, DC, we're not sending any requests and this is because there's a flight end date.
[56101:42] 6422275571455599916: So we're not sending anything.
[56141:42] 6422275571455599916: Can I remove the end date or are you renegotiating something, with the team?
[56258:02] 2174463968188460547: Yeah, like October is having some issues.
[56304:02] 2174463968188460547: So, I'm just contacting Amanda.
[56344:42] 2174463968188460547: I'm not seeing any delivery impressions on the gan inventory or the kdenn inventory for finecast.
[56445:02] 2174463968188460547: So, I don't think they've set up the demand yet for October.
[56505:02] 6422275571455599916: No, but we're not sending anything.
[56551:32] 6422275571455599916: Let me share.
[56573:02] 2174463968188460547: Oh, you're not in from kdenn?
[56625:02] 6422275571455599916: From nowhere because, you know, on your DC connection with group M, you see my screen?
[56736:02] 6422275571455599916: Yeah, there's a flight end date, which is September.
[56820:12] 2174463968188460547: Oh, yeah.
[56834:32] 2174463968188460547: Can you remove that ASAP?
[56857:52] 6422275571455599916: Yeah… we need to remove that.
[57019:42] 368407373435503627: You can do indefinite.
[57060:12] 2174463968188460547: That's for gan and kdenn?
[57096:22] 6422275571455599916: Yeah.
[57112:22] 6422275571455599916: You have all of your inventory going through this one?
[57186:42] 2174463968188460547: Yes, and you have no end date?
[57222:02] 6422275571455599916: Yeah, I removed it.
[57243:42] 6422275571455599916: I just wanted to check with you first if, yeah.
[57291:42] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[57296:02] 2174463968188460547: Thanks for that.
[57308:22] 2174463968188460547: I just let, I just let WPP know.
[57340:42] 2174463968188460547: Can you please start spending, but it looks like we're not actually sending any requests.
[57432:22] 6422275571455599916: Yeah.
[57458:02] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[57524:12] 6422275571455599916: Okay.
[57527:52] 6422275571455599916: Thank you.
[57628:42] 368407373435503627: Thank you.
[57739:42] 8255223483067911558: And one other question, like, I know Sophie already answered that question.
[57803:02] 8255223483067911558: Why are we not seeing the ad domains in the ad quality tool?
[57966:22] 8255223483067911558: How, I mean, how or why system or the demand side is not passing that race or domain info… or is there any way to… get it fixed?
[58224:22] 8255223483067911558: So that link will see ad domain 100 percent of the time?
[58325:12] 368407373435503627: So, yeah.
[58352:52] 368407373435503627: So if it's not passed in by the demand, like springster tries to detect it, if it's not able to detect it, then it's going to stay blank.
[58557:12] 368407373435503627: So, if there's no ad domain, that means that we were not able to detect it and it wasn't passed in.
[58734:52] 368407373435503627: But this sad, we're gonna just upgrade our detection and I think we're there, there's work on it to make sure because, you know, our detection is also based on what we see, we're able to scan through the creative if there's only music we might not be able to detect the domain or things if there's no wording, but, yeah.
[59233:42] 368407373435503627: So at the moment, if it's not, there is because it wasn't passed or, okay.
[59347:42] 8255223483067911558: So just curious to know.
[59384:02] 8255223483067911558: So when a user uploads a creative into a DSP and the DSP is responding to a bid response, usually it will come with another creative id and the ad domain and the category, all those things, right?
[59571:22] 8255223483067911558: From a DSP.
[59592:22] 8255223483067911558: So, is there, any case or any situation where the ad domain is not passed from the DSP?
[59733:12] 368407373435503627: This, I don't know if like there is a possibility to like this would have to be run in the DSP to see if like they put, they actually put the domain in everything or I don't know if like there's something that you can run on the programmatic side.
[60062:52] 8255223483067911558: I think like all the DSP whenever a creative is uploaded.
[60130:32] 8255223483067911558: So the domain should be in there.
[60200:52] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[60234:32] 8255223483067911558: And it should match also with the creative.
[60285:32] 8255223483067911558: Otherwise like the creative won't get approved in the DSP.
[60365:02] 8255223483067911558: So the users are adding the domain or system detects the domain and add a category to it.
[60586:42] 368407373435503627: Right.
[60627:22] 368407373435503627: So not… really sure.
[60715:22] 368407373435503627: So what is the percentage of creatives that you see without domain?
[60861:02] 368407373435503627: Is that?
[60907:02] 8255223483067911558: I can't say the person it is.
[60966:02] 8255223483067911558: So the thing is that, for example, you know, I was this, I mean, we were discussing about the creatives being captured in cadence system, right?
[61133:22] 8255223483067911558: So when there is something wrong with the creative, they started sharing the creative URL.
[61241:02] 8255223483067911558: So I used that creative, I mean, the media file URL into this ad quality tool to find that.
[61345:42] 8255223483067911558: So that's the first step.
[61364:02] 8255223483067911558: If not, I will play the ad.
[61401:42] 8255223483067911558: And then I see the domain and then I search with the domain.
[61456:02] 8255223483067911558: So if the domain is detected by spring serve, yes, it will show, but there are some cases where it was not showing the domain.
[61595:02] 8255223483067911558: So was not able to actually, you know, catch the creative, right?
[61699:02] 368407373435503627: And, you know, because I don't know how long we keep that.
[61781:22] 368407373435503627: Was it, like, yes.
[61837:22] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[61882:22] 8255223483067911558: So whenever the transcoding fails, so they immediately send a notification to us.
[61977:12] 8255223483067911558: So it's not like, you know, the creatives were serving in the last two weeks.
[62087:52] 8255223483067911558: So it's about the trigger which happened very recent.
[62147:52] 8255223483067911558: So it can be today or aesthetic.
[62239:52] 368407373435503627: Can you send me?
[62270:32] 368407373435503627: So you sent the creative, right?
[62302:32] 368407373435503627: No.
[62309:12] 8255223483067911558: I couldn't find the creative that's why, like I didn't send, but like I worked with our cadent team.
[62413:32] 8255223483067911558: So I think now they are sharing the creative media file for me, so.
[62541:12] 368407373435503627: Yeah, with something I can identify.
[62605:52] 368407373435503627: But if there is no, nothing coming through, so we know… which the DSP sent the creative, or not even like we don't know anything about this?
[62926:52] 8255223483067911558: So if it is a complete pass, then there are chances that I may be able to understand which DSP is sending it, but it's just the media files, media file, media urls being sent for the transcoding.
[63123:32] 8255223483067911558: So not really clear.
[63165:52] 368407373435503627: Right.
[63210:32] 8255223483067911558: And one more question.
[63226:32] 8255223483067911558: So how this vast hatch is created?
[63270:32] 8255223483067911558: Is that created automatically by the system or is there any logic behind it?
[63350:52] 8255223483067911558: Like, you know, we can, it is taking some ad id or something from the creative vast URL, and then creating this vast hash.
[63498:32] 368407373435503627: No, that's created randomly inside spring serve.
[63585:32] 368407373435503627: Yeah, I see that there is like some… a lot of them that don't have a declare advertiser domain in your system.
[63778:52] 368407373435503627: Let's see if they have like detected what's a… detected… unknown.
[63955:42] 368407373435503627: There's.
[63972:22] 368407373435503627: Yeah, there's a… few impressions.
[64118:12] 6422275571455599916: And.
[64233:52] 368407373435503627: I will ask my, the tech team to, if they can share more about why we don't have a domain for everything because, I know that's what the explanation is.
[64488:52] 368407373435503627: But if you say like the DSP would always share the a domain then it just doesn't make sense that there's a lot of them not there.
[64675:52] 8255223483067911558: So that I'm trying to connect another point here.
[64730:32] 8255223483067911558: So there was a case from Chetan before.
[64776:52] 8255223483067911558: So Sophia, like, you figured out that the domain was seen in streaming but like went from streaming to spring serve that information was missing.
[64949:52] 8255223483067911558: So I'm trying to connect these two points now.
[65018:12] 368407373435503627: You're saying that there's the information the advertiser domain information was present in streaming?
[65124:52] 368407373435503627: Yes?
[65216:22] 368407373435503627: Yeah, that's some definitely something that we should bring up to part of if you can give me that example… because, yeah.
[65388:42] 8255223483067911558: That example, I don't think we'll be able to consider now because I remember Sophia made some override.
[65534:52] 6422275571455599916: Yeah.
[65537:42] 6422275571455599916: I had to check every creative that was coming on the ad quality tool and override the advertiser domain, the iib category, everything.
[65751:42] 6422275571455599916: Yeah.
[65773:02] 368407373435503627: And that was instead like passed in for sure by mctv.
[65856:22] 368407373435503627: You're sure of that.
[65905:02] 8255223483067911558: And one more thing I can confirm is that like when this tool was initially launched, I played a lot with that tool.
[66012:02] 8255223483067911558: So I used to see all the ad domains, but eventually like after so many months, so some of the creatives are not showing that domain, so.
[66168:02] 368407373435503627: Okay.
[66175:42] 368407373435503627: So you think like that, the ad domain rate, has been going down and it's not because like there might be like some writing issue on the tool, we can definitely investigate that.
[66422:52] 368407373435503627: I'll make a note and I'll create a ticket for this because yes, if, like the, especially if like the media assets are coming, I mean, I guess we could like just figure out where, the demand is coming from mostly and then figure out like why it wouldn't I.
[66831:52] 6422275571455599916: think if you go now to the ad quality tool, you're gonna see you're gonna see a lot of… creative… with no advertiser domain, right?
[67053:52] 368407373435503627: On.
[67064:52] 6422275571455599916: the first page there's like tens of which is… it was not the case before.
[67181:12] 6422275571455599916: So I think that something is not working… yes.
[67294:32] 368407373435503627: Okay.
[67349:52] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[67372:52] 368407373435503627: I'll… bring this up, but I know that we're changing our internal detection like this month.
[67554:12] 368407373435503627: So this should be improving, you know, but as you said, if like if it's passed in, there shouldn't even be a problem because… if it's passed in most of the time, let… me just see which demands actually not similar according to us.
[67924:32] 368407373435503627: And then, okay.
[67997:42] 8255223483067911558: So it's completely random.
[68031:42] 8255223483067911558: So I see like empty ad domain from magnate reserve demand.
[68116:02] 8255223483067911558: So this one is like there's no domain detected and the demand is there's nothing in the demand.
[68237:22] 8255223483067911558: So that, that's another weird thing.
[68269:02] 8255223483067911558: And here, this one doesn't have a domain, but the demand is coming from mctv.
[68361:02] 8255223483067911558: Then I saw something else with magnate reserve 60 percent as the demand source.
[68487:12] 368407373435503627: So,
[68497:12] 8255223483067911558: it's happening everywhere wait.
[68532:52] 368407373435503627: These are the ones that don't have it.
[68562:52] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[68578:12] 8255223483067911558: These are the one doesn't have a domain kind of associated.
[68625:12] 368407373435503627: Yeah, which… is funny because it should be readable.
[68733:12] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[68748:12] 8255223483067911558: So, it's something like there's a miss between a streaming and spring circle.
[68869:12] 368407373435503627: Yeah… definitely will investigate this… okay.
[69074:02] 2114087984175195171: I just want to just piggyback on that.
[69103:02] 2114087984175195171: Sophia.
[69113:02] 2114087984175195171: The radio Canada deal is all fixed right now.
[69169:42] 2114087984175195171: The creative should be approved.
[69201:22] 2114087984175195171: There should be no issues.
[69227:02] 6422275571455599916: So, I don't I, unfortunately, I can't know because there's like tons of creative on the ad quality tool.
[69392:02] 6422275571455599916: There's like 132 pages of creative.
[69464:02] 6422275571455599916: So, and I have to go one by one, yeah, to see if there's another radio Canada creative that is not approved, but the deal is spending, right?
[69746:12] 6422275571455599916: I've just.
[69752:32] 2114087984175195171: Yeah, the deal is spending, but I think she said there's a few creatives that are going.
[69816:02] 2114087984175195171: Last time we spoke like this was like a few weeks ago, but a few were blocked, but I'll double check with the account manager we are seeing spend just making sure like everything is no issue on their end either.
[70021:52] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, one more like to the same topic.
[70088:12] 8255223483067911558: So we are seeing the radio Canada creative and streaming, right?
[70143:52] 8255223483067911558: But if you search radiocanada CA, domain in the ad quality tool, you won't find anything.
[70260:32] 8255223483067911558: So it could be because of this domain might maybe missing… in that culture too.
[70429:42] 6422275571455599916: Yeah, because when you don't have the advertiser domain, you don't have anything.
[70541:22] 6422275571455599916: I think the it's blocked like I have to approve it manually and this is what I've done for, the creatives that cheat and sent.
[70759:02] 6422275571455599916: I just watched the creative and run through the ad quality tool and see if I can find the same creative.
[70910:02] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[70913:02] 8255223483067911558: So this is another reason for my previous question.
[70955:02] 8255223483067911558: So how this creative Vash, sorry, vast hash is created?
[71012:42] 8255223483067911558: So, is it created in sprinter or is it created in mctv?
[71086:02] 8255223483067911558: So in.
[71104:02] 368407373435503627: Spring serve?
[71110:42] 8255223483067911558: In spring.
[71123:02] 8255223483067911558: So, right.
[71129:42] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, so.
[71197:42] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[71296:52] 368407373435503627: I thought about like, actually, I went back onto the channel thing.
[71394:12] 368407373435503627: If you want to pass in, if you're able to pass into spring serve the actual channel name and you want to pass it out into content channel, you… can also pass it, in a different key.
[71659:52] 8255223483067911558: And.
[71691:52] 368407373435503627: then we're going to override the channel name with that key.
[71817:32] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[71820:32] 8255223483067911558: So how we leave override channel name with that key?
[71878:52] 8255223483067911558: Where in?
[71909:32] 368407373435503627: In the, in the settings in?
[71957:32] 8255223483067911558: The settings of macro override exactly.
[72001:52] 8255223483067911558: But like there is nothing called… channel, sorry, content channel there?
[72178:02] 368407373435503627: Yeah.
[72198:22] 368407373435503627: There's channel name.
[72215:02] 368407373435503627: So, you're gonna override channel name with that key and then it's gonna output as content channel.
[72319:42] 368407373435503627: So channel name, incoming outputs a content channel.
[72383:22] 368407373435503627: I know it's a little, yes.
[72408:42] 8255223483067911558: I think that will work.
[72434:22] 8255223483067911558: Yeah, the reason is that channel name is relevant only for us and printer, not for the buyer, right?
[72553:22] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[72563:02] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[72578:22] 8255223483067911558: So.
[72603:42] 368407373435503627: Basically… you're passing the channel name with right right now as it is.
[72700:12] 368407373435503627: And so you're targeting on that channel name, and then you pass into the actual channel name that you want to output into another key.
[72868:52] 368407373435503627: And then we override the channel name in spring serve with that key.
[72966:52] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[72974:12] 8255223483067911558: I understood what you mean.
[72991:12] 8255223483067911558: Okay.
[72998:12] 8255223483067911558: So now, I need to find like, you know, what exact value I should be passing.
[73070:42] 8255223483067911558: Okay, I will experiment.
[73086:52] 8255223483067911558: This probably will have an answer, in our next meeting.
[73144:12] 8255223483067911558: Okay?
[73158:32] 368407373435503627: Sounds good.
[73168:52] 368407373435503627: Okay?
[73199:02] 2174463968188460547: Thanks, guys and Sophia, last one, I just put some prioritizations to those in the list.
[73290:32] 2174463968188460547: Thank.
[73304:42] 6422275571455599916: You, so.
[73325:22] 2174463968188460547: Crave prime absolute priority for us.
[73374:42] 2174463968188460547: The rest of it's going to be 20 22.
[73416:22] 2174463968188460547: I'll be honest because, sorry?
[73459:52] 368407373435503627: 20.
[73481:02] 2174463968188460547: 26, I put number two as the uid.
[73546:02] 2174463968188460547: Yeah, and he was already playing with that.
[73570:02] 2174463968188460547: Anyway, number three is, the Pio deployment, but we are still working on our entire PG process with magnate.
[73719:42] 2174463968188460547: I know we did it a couple times and it works technically, but we don't have the operations in place to make a magnet PG yet.
[73836:42] 6422275571455599916: Okay.
[73851:42] 6422275571455599916: And.
[73874:42] 2174463968188460547: Then for the audio integration, if you want to continue with Chantal, just do a tag there.
[73962:22] 2174463968188460547: Yeah.
[73983:12] 2174463968188460547: And then the last one is the enabling our bell first party data in magnate that's going to require like dev work on our side and… budgets.
[74160:12] 6422275571455599916: Not an accent and easy activation, no.
[74212:12] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[74287:52] 6422275571455599916: All right.
[74329:32] 6422275571455599916: And then the presenters, yeah.
[74388:32] 2174463968188460547: 20 26.
[74470:32] 6422275571455599916: Okay.
[74519:32] 6422275571455599916: Chetan.
[74527:32] 6422275571455599916: Did you have anything else?
[74594:02] 2114087984175195171: No, that was it for me.
[74614:22] 2114087984175195171: Yep.
[74621:22] 6422275571455599916: Yeah.
[74630:42] 6422275571455599916: I saw an email from you for Amazon.
[74680:22] 2114087984175195171: That was just basically, I think just to, if you guys have any insight, how we could get more ad impressions for that ad request for that deal.
[74846:42] 2114087984175195171: But based off our conversations internally, like majority of it is limited because we have high sellouts on PG and they're also, they also have very tight, they do have, they have city level targeting.
[75033:02] 2114087984175195171: Yeah.
[75037:22] 2114087984175195171: And so, and some of the cities, we really do not have impressions for co TBC.
[75118:22] 2114087984175195171: So there's not much we can do.
[75145:42] 2114087984175195171: I don't really think I just in case you guys had anything, but I don't think, yeah.
[75218:02] 6422275571455599916: I run a report this morning.
[75268:42] 6422275571455599916: I think same if they can like open up a little bit the targeting because you're sending enough requests, they're not within 100 percent of the time.
[75425:02] 6422275571455599916: So they're still.
[75441:42] 2114087984175195171: They have, I think they, the only targeting is Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto.
[75539:02] 2114087984175195171: So I asked them to make it province level and it will help, but we talked to our team internally.
[75628:22] 2114087984175195171: We have high sellouts on PG and direct.
[75657:42] 2114087984175195171: So there's not much we can do.
[75683:22] 2114087984175195171: I just in case it was like a SSP issue.
[75721:02] 2114087984175195171: I wasn't seeing.
[75735:42] 2114087984175195171: I just wanted to see you guys in that.
[75772:42] 6422275571455599916: If you can just let me know for the radio Canada if can they like pull a report by creative and see?
[75896:42] 2114087984175195171: Yeah, that's what I just asked if they, if they're still having issues, just let us know which specific creative and then we can manually map it that way because it's tough.
[76052:32] 2114087984175195171: Yeah, there's so many there.
[76081:52] 2114087984175195171: So I appreciate your help with that too.
[76108:12] 2114087984175195171: Thank you so much.
[76118:12] 6422275571455599916: Of course, I had one last thing I was thinking of reorganizing the way we are doing our call.
[76340:32] 6422275571455599916: I just wanted to structure it differently.
[76399:02] 6422275571455599916: I'm just thinking out loud.
[76431:52] 6422275571455599916: But for example, we could start maybe with anything spring serve related, so Julia can jump and then she can leave, if she wants, and then we can move to streaming and DV plus projects related, or I don't know if you want to keep it that way and discuss the big projects and then troubleshoot afterwards.
[76887:22] 6422275571455599916: Just let me know what you think I.
[76949:42] 8255223483067911558: Mean, that's how we were doing it before, but somehow like, you know, we missed us started mixing up all the topics, but yes, I agree with that.
[77085:22] 8255223483067911558: So that like, you know, Julia can leave after her topics are done or anyone else.
[77198:22] 8255223483067911558: Yeah.
[77212:22] 6422275571455599916: We can try that.
[77230:42] 6422275571455599916: Let's do like by UI, start with spring serve, then jump to streaming and then DV plus TM and see how it works.
[77421:02] 6422275571455599916: And then if it's not working well, we can always revert back to how we're doing it right now, yep.
[77537:42] 2174463968188460547: Sounds good.
[77546:22] 6422275571455599916: Sounds good.
[77566:12] 6422275571455599916: And in the meantime, if you have anything else, shoot me an email sure.
[77661:32] 2174463968188460547: Cool.
[77670:12] 2174463968188460547: Let us know the moment you see requests coming in.
[77723:52] 6422275571455599916: No, it's, I already see them.
[77752:32] 6422275571455599916: It's fixed.
[77761:12] 6422275571455599916: Okay?
[77772:52] 2174463968188460547: Good.
[77776:52] 2174463968188460547: I guess October first technically entered though with fine cast.
[77847:52] 2174463968188460547: Yeah.
[77868:52] 6422275571455599916: We've missed two days unfortunately, but glad that we catch it up like today and not on Monday.
[77973:12] 2174463968188460547: Yeah.
[77988:52] 2174463968188460547: Okay.
[78040:22] 6422275571455599916: Yeah.
[78055:12] 6422275571455599916: So we removed the end date.
[78093:12] 6422275571455599916: So we should have the same issue.
[78147:02] 2174463968188460547: OK, have a.
[78203:52] 6422275571455599916: Good weekend.
[78222:02] 6422275571455599916: Thanks.
[78232:22] 2174463968188460547: You guys.
[78246:52] 2174463968188460547: Bye.
